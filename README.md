Data engineering using pre-labelled tweet and text messages from real life disasters; thanks to the company Figure Eight.

## Introduction
After a disaster has occurred there are usually there are millions of communications just at the time that disaster response organizations have the least capacity to retrieve the most important messages.
Different organizations would generally take care of specific parts of the problem, like water, medical supplies, blocked roads. These are the categories which Figure Eight has pulled out of the data.
This could be used in future disaster relief projects to benefit people affected during hard times.

Supervised ML is more accurate than a person performing keyword searches, and this is an issue in disaster relief.
The data has been repaired with an ETL pipeline and then a machine learning pipeline was used to build a supervised learning model.
